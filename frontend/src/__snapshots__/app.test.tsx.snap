        Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        Here at Toro we have to build tools that make navigating and managing a large number of disparate metrics and datasets fast and approachable to a variety of different end users - analysts, data scientists, PMs, and engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this challenge, you will be given APIs to retrieve tables and metrics associated with them and your goal is to create an interface for users to navigate these metrics.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Requirements
      </h2>
      <p>
        There are no restrictions on how to design and implement the interface, but be ready to discuss both your technical and product decisions. We expect you to spend no more than two hours on this project, and if you have any questions or issues, feel free to reach out to [redacted].
      </p>
      <p>
        When youâ€™re done, email [redacted] with a link to a GitHub repo or a zip of your files, and instructions on how to run your project.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the final deliverable, as a user of your interface, I should: Be able to navigate to all of the metrics available to me See all of the configuration for a particular metric
